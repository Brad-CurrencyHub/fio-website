The FIO Protocol is one form of innovation that ChangeNOW can adopt to increase
                            everyday functionality to reduce user error in exchanges and make the exchange process
                            much easier. We canâ€™t wait to start working with FIO and make the crypto space more
                            accessible to the general public, one step at a time.
